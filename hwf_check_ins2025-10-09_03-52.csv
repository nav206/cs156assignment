A straight consistent commitment to something spontaneous such as watching a documentary that was not planned and was substituting other intentions, and getting swayed by the instant gratifications only to shy away from the actual work -- feels like tendency to revert back to old habitual cycle of dopamine floods, laziness, blame searching. 

Getting sleepy afterwards did not help. Instead, locked myself in the bathroom for 10+ minutes, got woken up by the LED red lights. Angrily, unhappily, pushed for completing and compensating for the ""lost time"". 

Now it's 2am, and although brain processing speed has reduced by many folds, I am punishing myself, not budging unless I finish the prep. (25 more pages...) Can this be a journal and not a written piece for you four to critique and push your suggestions/opinions onto me?

Actually.. the little (norm like) interactions that stress you out? Totally avoidable. Here's the trick. Don't initiate them. Don't try something you wouldn't naturally. But, definitely be receptive!

Cooked dinner (yums!), but socializing later was tough initially. Got called out, not so gently afterwards by girlfriend ji. 

Proud that the conversation had potential to go south, but we talked it out and in less than 2-3 minutes I had a different energy. Room for improvment - acknowledge her feelings and observations, make that discussion time less than a minute, and ideally that conversation doesn't need to happen (if low on social battery - give your people a heads-up!) let them be in the known!

Got back home very late; waiting for the bus was such a tiring adventures (we must've missed like 6-8 buses). Ordered an Uber, which was expensive (thinking of last night alone- spending was a total around: 36000 ARS ballpark; of which I bore around 25000. (~ 25$). 

Came home tired, and pretty much slept immediately; waking up at 9 - have a LOT to do. But I'll go to the gym first and get a strong start of the day. I feel comfortable as is.

""I didn't ask for help."" - for CP practicum slides was an encounter I don't think went gently and then the food followed with cold silence. Then, I took a lot of time to freshen yand do the dishes realizing that I had already built up anger and argument - neither of which I want to unleash. So I come back to do my work, and she ruffles my back, but without response.  I guess she prefers to go back sleep and I don't stop her. 

With that, I still feel a huge amount of discomfort and the unfair expectation that my partner is supposed to not make me feel that way- translates into anger. But remember there's no supposed to be.","[]","[]"

If I am interpreting and feeling this correctly, It is a bit unjust of how much say I have in terms of expressing hurt or not. 

Two things- if things are talked about in the moment- if I engage, it quickly is perceived as an argument that you want to avoid or exit. 

If I choose to postpone it and talk about in the future, perhaps in a more neutral and benefit of the hindsight tone, I'm held against not talking about it at the moment.

[Actually that's not true. You hold it against me if I am silent and not telling you what's off/wrong at the moment only to bring it up later.]","[]","[]"

1) I'm doing the prep way early.
2) i am sincerely doing the prep, not just the bare minimum.
3) i am learning new things, as well as I have feedback and questions from my work- to ensure my efforts are meaningful and can be impactful. I am hopeful my engagement will be helpful to someone else too, and I'm looking for possible contribution or collaboration.
